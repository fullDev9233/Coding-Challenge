# Coding Test to fetch NFTs from Opensea

This DApp is built with Next, TypeScript and MUI. I used Web3 to display the currency properly.

## Missing

Unable to use Opensea Mainnet API as Opensea API is not approved. So I used Opensea Testnet API. Testnet API does not support getting list of NFTs for a given address. So I listed 30 NFTs on Opensea Testnet.

## How to run DApp

```
yarn dev
```

## How to build DApp

```
yarn build
```
